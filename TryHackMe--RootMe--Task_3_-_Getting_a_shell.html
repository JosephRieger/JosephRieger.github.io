<body><div class="page"><h1 class="title">Task 3 - Getting a shell</h1><br/><strong>Find a form to upload and get a reverse shell, and find the flag.</strong><br /><br />    Used Pentesmonkey's reverse PHP shell for this: <a href="https://github.com/pentestmonkey/php-reverse-shell/blob/master/php-reverse-shell.php">https://github.com/pentestmonkey/php-reverse-shell/blob/master/php-reverse-shell.php</a><br />    <br />    Changed the IP to my own and renamed it to ‘monkey.php.123’ to bypass the upload filter. First I attempted to smuggle the file as ‘monkey.php.jpg’, but Apache wouldn't execute it when opened in the /uploads/ directory.<br />    <br />    After changing the extension to ‘.123’ it worked because Apache sees it as a file with multiple extensions but it doesn't recognize ‘.123’. So as a fall back it executes it as a PHP-File.<br />    <br />    Before actually executing it a listener was set up on the attack machine using Netcat:<br />         nc -lvp 8080      <br />         <br />     The flag is in the /var/www/ folder.<br />     <br />   <strong>  Answer: THM{y0u_g0t_a_sh3ll} </strong>                             </div></body></html>
