Icecast, or well at least this version running on our target, is heavily  flawed and has a high level vulnerability with a score of 7.5 (7.4  depending on where you view it). What type of vulnerability is it?

For this section of the room,  we'll use the Metasploit module associated with this exploit.

What  is the full path (starting with exploit) for the exploitation module?  This module is also referenced in '</strong><a href="https://tryhackme.com/room/rpmetasploit">RP: Metasploit</a><strong>' which is recommended to be completed prior to this room, although not entirely necessary. </strong><br />• exploit/windows/http/icecast_header<br /><br /><br /><br />                                                                                        <br /><strong> Let's go ahead and select this module for use.
