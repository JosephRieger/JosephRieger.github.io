If the scanned port is open, instead of sending the last ACK package nmap sends a RST (reset) package. If the port is closed the server sends a RST package instead of a SYN/ACK. If the port is filtered (blocked via firewall or the host is down) nmap retries sending SYN packages.<br /><br />nmap scripts:<br /><a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/">https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/</a><br /><br />When was Snort created?<br />1998<br /><br />What are the port numbers of the three services running?<br />1. nmap -A 10.10.62.145<br />2. -A tries to identify all running services<br />80,2222,3389<br /><br />Run a scan and provide the <code>-Pn</code> flag to ignore ICMP being used to determine if the host is up<br />1. -Pn stands for “no ping”.
