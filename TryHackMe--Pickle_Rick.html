<body><div class="page"><h1 class="title">Pickle Rick</h1><br/><br /><br /><h2>Summary:</h2><br /><br />In this challenge we are presented with a webserver, which serves a hidden website. The hidden website itself features a commandline interface through which commands can be executed on the server.<br />However, common commands to print the contents of a file to the screen are filtered. This is circumvented by copying the contents of files to the standard output using ‘cp’.<br /><br /><br /><br /><strong>What is the first ingredient Rick needs?</strong><br /><br />    Scanning the machine with <code>sudo nmap -A &lt;IP&gt;</code> reveals that there's an SSH server running on port 22 and an HTTP server running on port 80.<br />    <br />    Visiting the site and inspecting the source code reveals that the username is ‘R1ckRul3s’.<br />    <br />    Scanning for hidden directories using GoBuster shows us that there's a robots.txt file.<br />    It contains ‘Wubbalubbadubdub’, which might be a password. However, the SSH server does not allow password logins.<br />    <br />    After enumerating the directories further this time using <br />    <code>gobuster dir -u 10.10.80.179 -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt -x php,html</code><br />    reveals /portal.php and /login.php.<br />    <br />    The -x flag makes GoBuster search not only for the terms in the wordlist but also for the terms with those passed extensions appended.<br />    <br />    Visiting this site we can use the username that was left in a comment of the index.html page and the password that was found in the robots.txt file to log in.<br />    <br />    The first page that we are presented with allows us to execute commands. ‘ls’ shows us that there is a file called ‘Sup3rS3cretPickl3Ingred.txt’. However, it's not possible to print its contents using commands such as ‘cat’, ‘head’, ‘tail’, etc.<br />    <br />    However, file redirection allows us to circumvent this restriction:<br />        <code>cp foo /dev/stdout</code><br />        <br />    We can simply copy the contents to the standard output.<br />    <br />    <br /><strong>    Answer: mr. meeseek hair</strong><br /><br /><br /><br /><strong>What is the second ingredient Rick needs?</strong><br /><br />    Looking around the website, we can see that all other parts are blocked and we're only served a page called denied.php.<br />    <br />    This means that we will have to continue to use the console interface to find the other ingredients on the server itself.<br />    <br />    Looking into the /home directory, we can see that there are two folders within it. One is called ‘ubuntu’ and the other one is called ‘rick’.<br />    <br />    The ‘rick’ folder contains a file called ‘second ingredient’. Printing its contents to the screen the same way it was done in the first task, we can reveal the second ingredient.<br />    <br /><strong>    Answer: 1 jerry tear</strong><br /><br /><br /><br /><strong>What is the final ingredient Rick needs?</strong><br /><br />    Since this a CTF, it's safe to assume that the final ingredient is in the /root folder. Using ‘sudo -l’ we can check what commands we are allowed to use with ‘sudo’. As it turns out, we can use all of them.<br />    <br /><br />   First we can check that this assumption is correct and that the flag is, indeed, in the /root folder:   <br />   <code>sudo ls -la /root</code><br />   <br />   Afterwards, we can ‘print’ out the contents of 3rd.txt using the trick we discovered earlier<br />   <code>sudo cp /root/3rd.txt /dev/stdout</code><br />    <br /><strong>    Answer: fleeb juice</strong><br /><br /></div></body></html>
