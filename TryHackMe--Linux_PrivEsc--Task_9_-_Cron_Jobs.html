<body><div class="page"><h1 class="title">Task 9 - Cron Jobs</h1><br/><strong>How many cron jobs can you see on the target system?</strong><br /><br />    ‘cat /etc/crontab’<br />    <br />  <strong>  Answer: 4</strong><br /><br /><br /><strong>What is the content of the flag5.txt file?</strong><br /><br />    The flag is once again located in /home/ubuntu but we do not have access to it.<br />    There is however a cronjob running under root that executes a shell script in our home directory.<br />    <br />    We can append the following lines to it:<br />        cp /bin/bash /home/karen/rootbash<br />        chmod +xs /home/karen/rootbash<br />    <br />    It is important, however, to also make the file executable. Otherwise the cronjob will not run.<br />    <br />    Afterwards we can start this shell with ‘./rootbash -p’ to get root privileges within it. <br />    Then we can read the contents of the file.<br />    <br /> <strong>   Answer: THM-383000283</strong><br /><br /><br /><br /><strong>What is Matt's password?</strong><br /><br />    Having access to a root shell we can start a python server in the /etc directory and download /etc/shadow and /etc/passwd onto our attack box.<br />    <br />    There we can use John the Ripper to crack the hash as we did in task 7.<br />    <br />  <strong>  Answer: 123456</strong><br /></div></body></html>
